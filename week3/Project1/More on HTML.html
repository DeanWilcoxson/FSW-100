                <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
                <p>According to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=emotional+intelligence&rlz=1C1PRFI_enUS744US744&oq=Emotional+intell&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l2j46j0l3.6992j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Google,</a> Emotional Intelligence is the capacity
                    to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.</p>
                <p>
                    With that in mind, and with the understanding that the more you experience the more opportunities you'll have to further your empathetic skills. Its safe to say that Emotional intelligence is a learned behaviour and can be developed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I personally believe that as you get older, the experiences you have and the people you meet help you develop emotional intelligence naturally. That is why people say "wisdom comes with age". According to an article on <a href="https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/this-is-age-when-your-eq-peaks-according-to-science.html">Inc.com</a>                    by <mark>Jessica Stillman</mark>, studies have shown, emotional intelligence reaches its peak at around 60 years old.

                Psychologist <mark>Daniel Goleman</mark> Ph.D., author of the New York Times bestseller <em>Emotional
                    Intelligence
                    and Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships</em>, proposed that there are four competencies and skills that are the cornerstones of Emotional Intelligence:
                <ul>
                    <li>Self-Awareness</li>
                    <li>Self-Management</li>
                    <li>Social-Awareness</li>
                    <li>Relationship Management</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These four competencies and skills make up the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal, which is the measurement tool to figure out your EQ (Emotional Intelligence) </p>
